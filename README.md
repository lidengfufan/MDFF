#The MFDD dataset is a fatigue analysis dataset about EMG signals and smartwatch indicators. It contains the ARV and RMS of the EMG signal, the BPM and SPO2 of the smartwatch and their corresponding fatigue levels. The EMG signal data has been filtered, which provides a good foundation for subsequent fatigue analysis.
